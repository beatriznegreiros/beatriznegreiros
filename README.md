Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research associate doing PhD at the [Institute for Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) (University of Stuttgart) and passionate about programmatic approaches. My interests are on hydro-morphodynamic modelling and spatiotemporal analyses of rivers, which I leverage with fuzzy-based and data-driven methods, web development/scraping, and geospatial Python. My latest projects involved [hypothesis testing of bedload drivers](https://github.com/sschwindt/ms-bedload-seasons), a novel [fuzzy interpretation of riverbed clogging](https://flusstools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bedanalyst.html), and performing systematic literature review through hundreds of papers through [web scraping](https://github.com/beatriznegreiros/web-scraping-wos).
